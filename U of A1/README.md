# University of Alberta CMPUT Courses

Interactive map of the U of A Computer Science courses built with [D3.js](https://d3js.org). 
See course information on the [UBC Course Calendar](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/courses.cfm?page=code&code=MATH).

All data for the map is shown in data-ualberta.xlsx, which is scraped from the [U of A Website](https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue/search/results?keywords=)
The future goal would be to make this capable of recompiling itself without
need for manual intervention, but in order to do that I will need to make a 
better web-scraping program
